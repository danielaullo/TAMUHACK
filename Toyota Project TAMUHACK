Incorporating a service estimator for online customers that have a desire to know the total cost of owning vehicle.
My team and I concluded that we can appeal to a larger percentage of the audience to better suit their intentions when purchasing
a vehicle. Creating a service cost estimator will create the freedom for any onlince customer to calculate the true cost of owning a vehicle on an annual basis.

This program will also allow the user to gain better insight on specific services they would like to know about. For example, if a customer wants to know the cost of an oil change for their specific vehicle, they will be able to filter out their vehicle and their service to receive a cost ESTIMATE. It is important to emphasize that the prices seen on the website are only estimates and not the actual cost of the service.
